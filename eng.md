unfortunately, the network outputs will not necessarily obey the aforementioned constraints. Consequently, we pass the K outputs of the network through a function that ensures that these constraints are respected.

A suitable choice is ...

A vector of length K ...

This is known as  the ...

Often, we wish to ..., so ...

It is more usual to ...

we assume the errors in each are independent.

The independence assumption implies that the joint likehood of the two predictions is the product of individual likehoods.
